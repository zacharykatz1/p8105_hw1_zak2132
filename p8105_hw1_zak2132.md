## Problem 1

Problem 1 asks us to create a data frame comprised of: \* A random
sample of size 10 from a standard normal distribution \* A logical
vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 \* A
character vector of length 10 \* A factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

### Create the data frame

Let’s create the data frame.

``` r
rand_sample <- rnorm(10)
logical_vector <- rand_sample > 0
character_vector <- c("s", "t", "r", "a", "w", "b", "e", "r", "r", "y")
factor_vector <- factor(c("first", "second", "third", "first", "second", "third", "first", "second", "third", "first"))
test_data_frame <- data.frame(rand_sample, logical_vector, character_vector, factor_vector)
test_data_frame
```

    ##    rand_sample logical_vector character_vector factor_vector
    ## 1   -1.8133751          FALSE                s         first
    ## 2    0.2764048           TRUE                t        second
    ## 3    0.9940949           TRUE                r         third
    ## 4   -0.4184870          FALSE                a         first
    ## 5    0.1621003           TRUE                w        second
    ## 6    2.5780848           TRUE                b         third
    ## 7    0.5404049           TRUE                e         first
    ## 8    1.7195057           TRUE                r        second
    ## 9   -0.7837790          FALSE                r         third
    ## 10   1.0193254           TRUE                y         first

``` r
str(test_data_frame)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    10 obs. of  4 variables:
    ##  $ rand_sample     : num  -1.813 0.276 0.994 -0.418 0.162 ...
    ##  $ logical_vector  : logi  FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE ...
    ##  $ character_vector: chr  "s" "t" "r" "a" ...
    ##  $ factor_vector   : Factor w/ 3 levels "first","second",..: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1

#### Find the means

Now that we’ve created the data frame, we try to take the mean of each
variable.

``` r
sample_mean <- mean(test_data_frame$rand_sample)
mean_positive <- mean(test_data_frame$logical_vector)
mean_character_vector <- mean(test_data_frame$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(test_data_frame$character_vector): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor_vector <- mean(test_data_frame$factor_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(test_data_frame$factor_vector): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

-   The mean of the random sample is 0.427428 and the mean of the
    logical vector is 0.7, which is the proportion of the random sample
    greater than 0.

-   When we try to find the mean of the character and factor vectors, we
    learn that the mean function does not accept arguments that are not
    numeric or logical, and therefore returns NA.

#### Convert vectors

Finally, we want to convert the logical, character, and factor variables
to a numeric variable if possible.

``` r
convert_logical <- as.numeric(logical_vector)
convert_logical

convert_character <- as.numeric(character_vector)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
convert_character

convert_factor <- as.numeric(factor_vector)
convert_factor
```

-   Converting the logical vector to a numeric vector changed **true to
    1** and **false to 0**.

-   Converting the factor vector to a numeric vector changed **first
    level to 1, second level to 2, and third level to 3**.

-   Converting the character vector to a numeric vector resulted in
    **"NAs introduced by coercion**, leading to a vector composed only
    of 10 NAs.
